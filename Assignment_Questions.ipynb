        "\n",
        " - Compiled and interpreted languages differ primarily in how their code is executed by a computer. These differences impact performance, development workflow, and use cases.  \n",
        " - A compiled language translates source code into machine code using a compiler. This machine code is directly executed by the computer's CPU. Examples include C, C++, and Rust. Compiled programs generally run faster because the translation happens before execution. However, they require a separate compilation step, making the development cycle slower. Additionally, compiled programs are platform-dependent, meaning the executable must be rebuilt for different systems.  \n",
        "\n",
        " - An interpreted language, on the other hand, executes code line by line using an interpreter. Examples include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. Interpreted languages allow for faster development cycles since changes can be tested immediately without recompilation. They are platform-independent as long as an interpreter is available. However, they tend to run slower because the translation occurs during execution.   \n",
        " Some languages, like Java and Python, use hybrid approaches such as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation or bytecode interpretation to combine the benefits of both paradigms. These methods improve performance while maintaining flexibility"

        "##Q23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?  \n",
        "\n",
        "  - Python's memory management is largely automated, thanks to features like garbage collection and reference counting. However, this automation introduces several challenges, especially in scenarios requiring high performance or real-time processing.  \n",
        "  1. Memory Leaks:  Memory leaks occur when objects are no longer needed but are not released due to lingering references. This can lead to excessive memory consumption over time, especially in long-running applications. For example, circular references, where two or more objects reference each other, can prevent garbage collection from reclaiming memory.  \n",
        "  2. Fragmentation:  Memory fragmentation happens when memory blocks become scattered due to frequent allocation and deallocation. This can make it difficult to allocate large contiguous memory blocks, reducing efficiency. Fragmentation is particularly problematic in applications requiring consistent memory performance.  \n",
        "  3. Garbage Collection Overhead:  Python's garbage collector, while efficient, can introduce performance overhead. In real-time applications, the unpredictable nature of garbage collection pauses can disrupt time-sensitive operations. Managing this overhead requires careful tuning of the garbage collector or manual intervention.  \n",
        "  4. Inefficient Data Structures: Using memory-intensive data structures can exacerbate memory issues. For instance, lists and dictionaries, while versatile, may consume more memory than necessary. Choosing inappropriate data structures can lead to excessive memory usage.  \n",
        "  5. Lack of Manual Control: Python abstracts memory management, limiting developers' ability to manually allocate or deallocate memory. While this simplifies development, it can be a drawback in scenarios requiring fine-grained control over memory usage"

        "\n",
        " - Multithreading is a programming concept that allows an application to execute multiple threads concurrently within a single process. Threads are lightweight units of execution that share the same memory space, enabling efficient resource utilization and parallel task execution.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Key Features of Multithreading\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Concurrency: Multithreading enables multiple tasks to run simultaneously, improving application responsiveness. For example, in a word processor, one thread can handle user input while another checks spelling or saves backups.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process share memory and resources, reducing overhead compared to creating separate processes.\n",

        "3. Performance: On multi-core processors, threads can run in parallel, leveraging all available CPU cores for faster execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Responsiveness: Applications remain interactive even during lengthy operations. For instance, a web browser can load a video in one thread while allowing user interaction in another."
